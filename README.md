## A Brief of the Prototype:


### Features

- 🖥️ Standalone Flask API Server
- 🌐 Single Page APP(SPA) using React
- 🔐 JWT Auth
- ⚡ Real time user matching
- 🌍 Live user Location using google maps api



### AutoMate (at its current state prototype) can do the following:

#### 1. User Registration and Login:

New users can create an account by providing their details.
Existing users can log in with their credentials.

#### 2. User Preferences:

Users can set preferences for ride partners, such as age and gender.

#### 3. Location Access:

Upon successful login, the system prompts users to allow access to their current location.

#### 4. Dashboard and Map Display:

After granting location access, the dashboard displays a map embedded with the user's current location.

#### 5. Search for Destination:

Users can search for their destination, aided by an autocomplete feature using google maps api.


#### 6. Matching Nearby Passengers:

Our vv adavanced algorithm searches for other users within 500 meters who are traveling to the same destination.

#### - Matching Process:

If other users with the same destination are found, they are presented to the user as potential ride partners.

#### - Accept or Reject:

Users can choose to accept or reject a ride with the matched partner based on provided details.

#### - Route Planning:

If both parties accept the ride, the system redirects them to Google Maps with the final destination and the route to their mate's location as a waypoint.
